# meme-info
Data science 1 final project by Brad Latendresse

Program grabs multiple pages from the imgur API and grabs relevant info that is put into a database. Program also uses MSE to compare images to recognize similar "memes" (for this case I will be exaimining "Advice animal" memes b/c they are easy to differentiate)
